# Day 14

- Played with classes and objects
- Used inheritance
- Learned about access modifiers (private fields using `#`)
- Used the `static` keyword

## Summary

On Day 14, I focused on object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. I explored how to create and work with classes and objects, and how to utilize inheritance to create a class hierarchy. I also learned about access modifiers, specifically how to use the `#` symbol to create private fields that are only accessible within the class. Additionally, I used the `static` keyword to define methods that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class.
