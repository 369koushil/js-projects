# Day 12

## Error Handling

Today, I learned about error handling using `try` and `catch` blocks. Here are some key points:

### Exception Handling

- **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**:
  - **Checked Exceptions**: Must be handled in static languages. For example, file handling operations often require explicit exception handling.
  - **Unchecked Exceptions**: Not mandatory to handle in dynamic languages. Examples include array index out of bounds, arithmetic errors, and null pointer exceptions.

### Custom Exception Classes

- **Creating and Using Custom Exception Classes**:
  - You can create custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions in your code. This allows for more precise error handling and better error messages.
