## Rest and Spread Operators
- synatax is same for Rest and Spread operator but each have different puroses

### Spread Operator
- it is used for unpacking elements of array or object.
- Used over iterable objects like arrays and objects.
- Commonly used to copy an array or object.

### Rest Operator
- Used to collect multiple elements into a single array or object.
- Commonly used in function parameters and destructuring assignments.

## Template Literals
- Provides a way to create strings with embedded expressions.
- Enclosed by backticks (`` ` ``) and can contain placeholders indicated by `${expression}`.
- Supports multi-line strings and expression interpolation.

## Enhanced Object Literals
- Provides a more concise and readable way to define object properties and methods.

### Shorthand Property Names
- Allows you to omit the value if the key and variable name are the same.

### Shorthand Method Names
- Allows you to define methods without the `function` keyword.

### Computed Property Names
- Allows dynamic property names using expressions.

### Object Property Value Shorthand
- Allows you to include variables in an object without having to write both the key and the value explicitly.

### Method Definitions
- Provides a simpler syntax for defining methods within objects.

### Summary
Enhanced object literals make it easier to write and understand object-oriented JavaScript code by providing:
- **Shorthand property names**: Allows you to omit the value if the key and variable name are the same.
- **Shorthand method names**: Lets you define methods without the `function` keyword.
- **Computed property names**: Enables dynamic property names using expressions.
- **Concise method definitions**: Provides a simpler syntax for defining methods within objects.
