# Day 15

### Closures
- Explored the concept of closures in JavaScript, understanding how functions retain access to their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

### IIFE with Closures
- Examined Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and how they work with closures to encapsulate variables and methods.

### Module Creation
- Created a simple module to modify list items.
- Utilized an IIFE to return an object with `add`,`delete` and modify methods as key-value pairs.

### Memoization Sequence in Closures
- Studied memoization techniques within closures to optimize performance by caching previously computed results.
